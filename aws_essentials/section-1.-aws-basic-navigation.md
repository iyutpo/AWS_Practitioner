In "Billing preferences" you can set up email alert.

**Now, let's go back to AWS Homepage by clicking AWS logo on the top left of the page. Scroll down a little bit and expand "All Services". Click "EC2"**

**Next, we'll create a Billing Alert to help us ensure we do not exceed our billing threshold per month. Similarly, we can navigate to "Billing" page, and select "Billing preferences". Then, check the box of "Receive Billing Alerts".**

Then, you'll be able to get an alert via email when you're close or exceeded your billing threshold.

Then, in the navigation bar, we search "cloudwatch".

In next page, select "billing" under "Alarms". Then click "Create Alarm":

Select "Usage" --&gt; "By AWS Resource" --&gt; Check "EC2" box --&gt; "Select metric"

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2881%29.png)

In the next page, you can scroll down a little bit and select "Greater/Equal to". Type in the particular amount in "Define the threshold value" bar. Click "Next".

Then, you'll see "in Alarm" which means if your billing exceeds $1, you'll get an alarm. You'll also see "SNS" \(i.e. AWS's Simple Notification Service\). You can add an email address to be alarmed when your billing exceeds $1.

In "Billing preferences" you can set up email alert.

**Next, we'll create a Billing Alert to help us ensure we do not exceed our billing threshold per month. Similarly, we can navigate to "Billing" page, and select "Billing preferences". Then, check the box of "Receive Billing Alerts".**

Then, you'll be able to get an alert via email when you're close or exceeded your billing threshold.

Then, in the navigation bar, we search "cloudwatch".

Then, you'll see "in Alarm" which means if your billing exceeds $1, you'll get an alarm. You'll also see "SNS" \(i.e. AWS's Simple Notification Service\). You can add an email address to be alarmed when your billing exceeds $1.
